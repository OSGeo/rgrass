2021-12-14: repository re-named "rgrass" to prepare for the release of GRASS 8.0.

Interpreted interface between GRASS geographical information system and R, based on starting R from within the GRASS GIS environment, or running free-standing R in a temporary GRASS location; the package provides facilities for using all GRASS commands from the R command line.

If you use OSGeo4W on Windows, remember that you must start RStudio, Rgui or console R from within the OSGeo4W shell.
