### How to propose a change to rgrass

The `main` branch is the development branch for **rgrass**.
If you would like to contribute to **rgrass**, please target your PRs and contributions to this branch.

### Note

The **rgrass** package is the successor to the **rgrass7** package.
The `rgrass7` branch was the "target" maintenance source for the **rgrass7** package, at a time that both **rgrass7** and **rgrass** coexisted.
**rgrass7** development is no longer continued; the package has been archived on CRAN.
The `rgrass7` branch is kept for reference only.
